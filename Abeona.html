            Abeona was a fictional project I did at the University of Washington in which Expedia wanted to create a  mobile application for women who wanted to travel over the age of 50. The project gave us 2 weeks to do user research, create personas and user scenarios, and then create wireframes and mock-ups for the mobile application.

        <h1>My Role</h1>

            <p>    
                I worked on a team of 4 people on this project where I did a lot of user research, project management, and created high fidelity mock ups of the application.
