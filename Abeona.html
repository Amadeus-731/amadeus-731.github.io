            <p>    
            Abeona was a fictional project I did at the University of Washington in which Expedia wanted to create a  mobile application for women who wanted to travel over the age of 50. The project gave us 2 weeks to do user research, create personas and user scenarios, and then create wireframes and mock-ups for the mobile application.

        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <div class="abeonapanel">
            <p>    
                I worked on a team of 4 people on this project where I did a lot of user research, project management, and created high fidelity mock ups of the application.

        <h1>The User Research</h1>
        <div class="abeonapanel">
            <p>    
                In order to gather information on women over the age of 50 in such a short timeline as this two week project. I decided to do a few interviews as well as gathering data such as social media posts, and comments by women over the age of 50 to discover their pain points around traveling in order to create personas based around the common personalities traits, and needs of the women we researched.            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>The Personas</h1>
        <div class="abeonapanel">
            <p>    
                I created two personas, one based around a women who wants a more social group based travel experience in which they can make friends, while feeling safe through group based activities. The other persona I created was around a more independent, individualist woman who wants to experience new things on her own while also feeling confident that the activities theyâ€™re interacting with have been pre-vetted to be safe, and positive experiences.            </p>
