    <h1>Looking For Puppies</h1>
    <p>Hello My family is looking to adopt a puppy. We have a few requirements.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Puppy Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First we want a medium sized dog</li>
            <li>Second we want it to come with all it's vaccinations</li>
            <li>Third we would prefer it not be a pure bred dog.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
<div>
    <h2>Contact Info</h2>

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
    <p>Also my daughter is <strong>allergic to dogs</strong> so please try to make your dog hypoallergenic. But. Also, the dog must have hair, hairless dogs creep me out.</p>
    <p>I would prefer a goldendoodle or a poodle mix because I consider them the best dogs.</p>
