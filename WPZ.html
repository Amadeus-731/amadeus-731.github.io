            How it all began.
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>This project was a mock attempt to apply for the Woodland Park Zooâ€™s grant to support the generation of empathy towards animals, and wildlife  conservation. Myself and my team of 5 other people decided we wanted to reach out to and work with the woodland park zoo as sort of a stakeholder for this project. </p>
        </div>
        <h1>How to create empathy</h1>
        <div>
            <p>We started off by researching how people create empathetic connections to things, and we discovered that the woodland park zoo has an extensive resources in this particular subject.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Finding Pain Points and Oppertunities</h1>
        <div>
            <p>We then interviewed staff at woodland park zoo in order to discover their pain points and opportunities for problems we could solve through design. We discovered one of their major pain points was attracting an audience of teens and young adults who rarely visit the zoo, and a lot of their audience came from children, and parents.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Survey</h1>
        <div>
            <p>In order to understand the demographic of teenagers and you adults I created a survey, that asked about their passions for the environment, animals, and how they felt about zoos. I got around 30 responses which gave me some good data showing that young adults and adolescents were passionate about wildlife conservation and animals but sometimes they were wary about zoos just keeping animals captive for profit. We also discovered that people most often use TikTok and instagram primarily in that age group by asking them their most used and favorite social media applications.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Our solution</h1>
        <div>
            <p>We decided we would tell the story of an animal who got a second chance at life at woodland park zoo. Which would help audiences create an empathetic connection towards wildlife. That animal being Gunnar the Hawk would also familiarize local residents around Washington about local wildlife such as the red tailed hawk. We would then. Advertise our story on platforms such as TikTok in order to reach these younger audiences where they are at.</p>
