                This was a capstone project for my major at university. Myself and the team wanted to work with an
                actual organization in order to get experience working with a stakeholder so we reached out to the Wing
                Luke Museum in Seattle. We reached out to this museum in particular because we noticed there was a
                growing dislike toward the AAPI community during the pandemic and wanted to help out that community.

                When we reached out to Wing Luke to ask them if there was anything they would like us to design for
                them, they didn't really have an idea of what we could improve through design so we did some research to
                discover pain points and opportunities at Wing Luke.

                    Through data gathered from surveys, interviews with staff, and observational studies at Wing Luke I
                    was
                    able to create a profile of what type of people would visit the Wing Luke Museum, and used that data
                    to
                    generate personas.

                    I spent some time research local museums in the Seattle, area as well as considering other
                    businesses
                    with a consistently returning customer base to see how they generated customer, retention, and what
                    the
                    Wing Luke did different from these businesses.

            Myself and the team then presented these potential solutions to the Wing Luke Museum who then wanted us to
            particularly focus on customer retention.

                    After discussing the needs of the stakeholder we decided to iterate on designs that could
                    incentivize
                    customer return and we came to a consensus with Wing Luke on a collectable pin program, since they
                    are a
                    successful incentive seen in other businesses such as PAX's Pinny Arcade, and Disney Park's Pin
                    Collection and Trading program, and It would be within Wing Luke's budget to implement.

                    We then iterated on different experiences in which customers received pins, and presented those to
                    Wing
                    Luke. They decided they would go with my idea of a pin collection card cards.

                    I then created a design guide so that AAPI (Asian American, Pacific Islander) artists could created
                    artwork for both pins and the collection cards.

                I created 2D and 3D prototypes for a display case for the Wing Luke Museum, that would creatively
                display pins to customers.
